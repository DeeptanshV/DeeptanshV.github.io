## My process
I started by making a parent-div and then divided into two sub divs.The sub-div on the left hand side is for the information and the sub-div on the right is totally for the picture.
I centered the parent-div also added the colors, padding, font-sizes etc. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned
By making this project,I have improved by basic CSS skills and learned more about the proper way of using flexbox for the alignment of elements in a webpage.
I look forward to make my CSS knowledge stronger and improving this website by making it more interactive.
